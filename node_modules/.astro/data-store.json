Engineering colleges can't teach, graduates lack real skills despite having degrees, and society has normalized this dysfunction. We've created \"educated-yet-ignorant\" graduates who possess credentials but no competence, leading to massive resource waste and civilizational decline. The system survives through monopolistic control over degree distribution rather than educational quality.\n\nWe stand witness to one of the most devastating institutional failures of our time: the systematic transformation of India's higher educational system from engines of human capital development into elaborate theaters of credentialism. This phenomenon—what we term *educational parasitism*—represents institutions that extract societal resources while providing minimal genuine value, surviving purely through monopolistic control over credentials that society has been conditioned to accept as meaningful.\n\n\u003C/Aside>\n\n{/* ![Image](cover.jpeg) */}\n\n## \u003Cu>1. Defining Educational Parasitism: The Anatomy of Institutional Failure\u003C/u>\n\nEducational parasitism occurs when learning institutions maintain their social legitimacy and economic viability not through the quality of education they provide, but through their gatekeeping function in credentialization processes. Unlike biological parasites that weaken their hosts gradually, educational parasites create a more insidious form of damage: they manufacture what we might call *parha-likha-anparh*—the educated-yet-ignorant graduate who possesses degrees but lacks genuine competence.\n\nThis represents more than mere pedagogical incompetence; it signals a fundamental breakdown in the social contract between educational institutions and society. When ninety-nine percent of engineering colleges cannot effectively teach their core subjects, we witness not isolated failures but systemic collapse masquerading as educational expansion.\n\n## \u003Cu>2. The Credentialization Trap: Manufacturing Human Capital Stagflation\u003C/u>\n\nThe contemporary Indian higher education landscape exhibits characteristics remarkably similar to economic stagflation—credential inflation occurring simultaneously with competency stagnation. Students spend four years in engineering programs, companies hire these graduates for roles requiring no engineering knowledge, and society perpetuates this elaborate charade because each participant benefits from maintaining the fiction.\n\nThis dynamic creates what economists recognize as a classic coordination failure. Educational institutions profit from fee collection without delivering education, employers fill human resource requirements on paper while conducting extensive screening processes that effectively ignore formal credentials, and students receive degrees that function primarily as expensive signaling devices rather than indicators of actual capability.\n\nThe most troubling aspect lies in society's normalization of this dysfunction. We have collectively accepted that *\"college nahi parhayega\"* (colleges won't teach)—an abdication that would be unthinkable in other sectors. We would never accept hospitals that don't heal, courts that don't deliver justice, or bridges that don't bear weight, yet we have embraced educational institutions that don't educate.\n\n## \u003Cu>3. The Export-Import Syndrome: Protected Markets and Innovation Deficit\u003C/u>\n\nIndian educational institutions operate within what we might characterize as an import-substitution model of learning—they provide domestic alternatives to genuine education while remaining protected from international competition or meaningful quality assessment. Just as companies operating solely in protected domestic markets lack innovation incentives, our educational institutions face no external validation of their output quality.\n\nThis creates profound information asymmetries. Parents and students cannot easily assess educational quality, while employers develop elaborate screening mechanisms precisely because they cannot trust the credentials the system produces. The result is massive resource misallocation—society invests heavily in educational infrastructure that produces negative value.\n\nConsider the research infrastructure in premier institutions, where expensive imported equipment sits in laboratories that function more as museums than centers of innovation. PhD students describe their research environments as decorative spaces designed for publication generation rather than genuine scientific inquiry. This represents the completion of a vicious cycle where form has completely divorced from function.\n\n## \u003Cu>4. The Demographic Dividend Delusion: Staggered Unemployment as Policy\u003C/u>\n\nIndia's educational expansion strategy reflects what we term the \"demographic dividend fallacy\"—the belief that simply credentializing large numbers of people would automatically translate into economic growth. Instead, we have implemented a Chinese-style approach to unemployment management, keeping people in educational institutions longer to delay their entry into saturated job markets.\n\nThis strategy creates what economists call \"staggered unemployment\"—a system where potential joblessness is temporarily hidden within extended educational timelines rather than being addressed through genuine skill development or job creation. The recent phenomenon of major corporations indefinitely delaying onboarding for hundreds of graduates perfectly illustrates this system's ultimate unsustainability.\n\n## \u003Cu>5. The Missing Markets Problem: When Money Cannot Motivate\u003C/u>\n\nThis analysis reveals a fundamental challenge that extends beyond education into broader questions of social organization. Certain essential social functions—teaching, research, military service—may require motivational structures beyond simple financial incentives. Modern market economies assume that sufficient monetary rewards can attract talent to any necessary social function, but this assumption proves inadequate for roles requiring intrinsic motivation, social prestige, or long-term commitment.\n\nTraditional social structures once provided non-monetary incentives through guaranteed status, social recognition, and occupational pride. The breakdown of these structures without adequate market-based alternatives has created what economists recognize as \"missing markets\"—areas where necessary social functions lack effective coordination mechanisms.\n\nThis analysis leads us to an uncomfortable but important recognition: some form of occupational specialization with social reinforcement may be economically necessary, even if we reject the oppressive aspects of historical caste systems. The challenge lies in creating such specialization through voluntary rather than hereditary mechanisms.\n\n## \u003Cu>6. Global Competition and the Inevitability of Reckoning\u003C/u>\n\nIndia's educational dysfunction occurs within an increasingly competitive global context. As other developing regions rapidly improve their educational systems and artificial intelligence automates routine tasks, our elaborate system of credential distribution faces inevitable obsolescence. The comparison with Sub-Saharan Africa proves particularly sobering—regions we once considered less developed are now implementing educational reforms that may soon surpass our capabilities.\n\nThis global competitive pressure creates what we might call \"civilizational stakes.\" A society that cannot effectively transmit knowledge and skills to its younger generation has placed its long-term survival at risk. We face the potential end of India's demographic dividend not because our population is aging, but because we systematically waste human potential through institutional failure.","src/content/blog/abdication_1/index.mdx",[31],"./cover.jpeg","a551d37933b548c3","abdication_2",{"id":33,"data":35,"body":43,"filePath":44,"assetImports":45,"digest":46,"deferredRender":27},{"title":36,"description":37,"publishDate":38,"updatedDate":39,"heroImage":40,"tags":42,"language":25,"draft":26,"comment":27},"Fixing India's Failing Institutions","Bachelors isn't even worth it anymore honestly for a lot of people.

Colleges whose students consistently fail would be shut down. This creates direct accountability between educational quality and institutional survival, forces colleges to actually teach, and eliminates thousands of worthless degree mills while concentrating resources on institutions that work.\n\n\u003C/Aside>\n\n{/* ![Image](cover.jpeg) */}\n\n## \u003Cu>1. A Promising Solution: The Universal Competency Assessment Model\u003C/u>\n\nThe path toward reform may lie in implementing a comprehensive accountability system through mandatory competency examinations—a \"GATE Lite\" approach that could fundamentally reshape the educational landscape. This solution deserves serious consideration as it addresses the core dysfunction while creating powerful incentives for genuine improvement.\n\nThe mechanism would work as follows: Every engineering graduate would be required to take a standardized competency examination covering fundamental engineering principles—essentially a simplified version of the existing GATE exam. Crucially, this wouldn't be a high-stakes entrance test but rather a baseline competency assessment that every graduate must attempt after completing their degree.\n\nHere's how this can be advantageous: Students would receive modest financial rewards based on their performance—perhaps 1,000-2,000 rupees for decent scores. This isn't life-changing money, but it's enough to ensure students won't simply boycott the exam or deliberately perform poorly. Since they've already invested four years in their education and are sitting for the exam anyway, most would make a reasonable effort to score well for the small monetary incentive.\n\nThe real power lies in institutional accountability. Colleges whose graduates consistently perform poorly on these assessments would face closure. This creates a direct link between educational quality and institutional survival—something completely absent in the current system. Suddenly, colleges would have powerful incentives to actually teach rather than merely process students through degree mills.\n\nThe point of this approach would be is its simplicity and resistance to gaming. Unlike entrance examinations that can be manipulated through coaching, this system measures actual learning outcomes. Colleges cannot simply teach to the test because the syllabus is already their prescribed curriculum. They would be forced to genuinely improve their teaching quality to ensure their graduates can demonstrate basic competency.\n\nImplementation would face predictable resistance—particularly from the thousands of substandard institutions that would face closure. However, the economic logic is compelling. Why should society continue subsidizing institutions that provide negative value? The short-term disruption of closing ineffective colleges would be vastly outweighed by the long-term benefits of concentrating resources on institutions that actually educate their students.\n\nThis system would also solve the information asymmetry problem plaguing students and employers. Prospective students could evaluate colleges based on their graduates' competency scores, while employers would have reliable indicators of actual capability rather than meaningless degree certificates.\n\n## \u003Cu>2. Implementation and Broader Implications\u003C/u>\n\nThe universal competency assessment model represents more than educational reform—it's a mechanism for restoring genuine meritocracy to Indian society. By making institutional performance transparent and consequential, this system would naturally concentrate educational resources on effective institutions while eliminating the parasitic elements that currently drain societal resources.\n\nIT may be rightfully argued that closing thousands of colleges would create unemployment and social disruption. However, this perspective misses the crucial point: these institutions already fail to provide meaningful education or employment outcomes. Their closure would eliminate the elaborate fiction that wastes four years of students' lives and their families' resources while producing graduates unfit for productive employment.\n\nThe would logically also create powerful market incentives for innovation in education delivery. Institutions facing closure would be motivated to experiment with new teaching methods, hire competent faculty, and develop genuine expertise in their fields. The competitive pressure would drive educational innovation in ways that regulatory mandates have consistently failed to achieve.\n\nMoreover, this approach aligns with broader economic necessities. As global competition intensifies and artificial intelligence automates routine tasks, India desperately needs engineers capable of genuine innovation and problem-solving. The current system produces exactly the opposite—graduates trained to memorize and regurgitate information without developing analytical capabilities.\n\nThe financial aspects deserve particular attention. Rather than continuing to subsidize thousands of worthless institutions, society could redirect resources toward fewer, higher-quality colleges that demonstrate actual educational outcomes. This concentration of resources would enable these institutions to compete globally rather than merely existing as local degree mills.\n\n## \u003Cu>Conclusion: The Choice Before Us\u003C/u>\n\nWe face a stark choice between comfortable delusion and uncomfortable truth. We can continue maintaining illusions about our educational achievements while our competitive position erodes, or we can confront the reality that we have constructed an elaborate system for manufacturing ignorance and begin the difficult work of reconstruction.\n\nThe underlying economic forces are inexorable. India cannot indefinitely sustain educational institutions that consume resources while producing negative value. The question is not whether change will come, but whether we will initiate it proactively or have it imposed upon us through competitive failure.\n\nThe educated-yet-ignorant graduate represents more than a product of our broken system—they embody our society's choice of credentials over competence, appearance over substance, and comfortable delusions over difficult truths. Breaking free from this trap requires acknowledging that we have made fundamental errors in our approach to human capital development.\n\nOnly through such acknowledgment can we begin building educational institutions worthy of India's aspirations and equal to the challenges of global competition. The alternative is continued decline disguised as progress, until external forces compel the reckoning we lack the courage to initiate ourselves.","src/content/blog/abdication_2/index.mdx",[31],"0c70a09403f56db0","docs",["Map",49,50,59,60,69,70,79,80,89,90,98,99,107,108,116,117,125,126,135,136,145,146,154,155,163,164,172,173,209,210,251,252],"advanced/about",{"id":49,"data":51,"body":56,"filePath":57,"digest":58,"deferredRender":27},{"title":52,"description":53,"tags":54,"draft":26,"order":55},"About","About the project",[],5,"import { GithubCard } from 'astro-pure/advanced'\nimport { Button, Aside } from 'astro-pure/user'\n\nThe astro-theme-pure theme is open source under the [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/cworld1/astro-theme-pure/blob/main/LICENSE) license.

The code written in package may be frequently changed. If users change them at will, it will significantly increase the cost of subsequent updates and merging (various conflicts for code)\n2. Roll back and switch between different versions easily, to maintain user stability\n3. Reduce system coupling & increase reuse ability\n4. The NPM Package mode can be used as a \"Astro plugin\" to append additional operations that enhance user experience during the build phase\n5. Support some built-in commands like new, check, info, etc.\n6. Use as component library for other Astro projects (yes, this project can be broken down into the UI component library): [Package details](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-pure).\n\nBefore you customize it, you should check [`site.config.ts`](/docs/setup/configuration#theme-configuration) to make sure there is no option that satisfy your need.\n\n## Swizzling\n\nThis theme chose an elegant method called 'Swizzling', which is inspired by the design from [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling).\n\n1. Use an IDE to quickly view the source code corresponding to a certain component (In VSCode, it is to click the component with \u003Ckbd>Ctrl\u003C/kbd>).\n2. Copy to `src/components/\u003Cyour prefer directory>`.\n3. After modification, change the corresponding reference to your own file path.\n\nLet's make an example to customize the `Footer` component:\n\n\u003CSteps>\n1. Search the `Footer` in your project code:\n\n   ```astro title=\"src/layout/BaseLayout.astro\"\n   ---\n   import { Footer, Header, ThemeProvider } from 'astro-pure/components/basic'\n   import type { SiteMeta } from 'astro-pure/types'\n   // ...\n   ---\n   ```\n\n2. Find it in theme source code:\n\n   ```ts title=\"node_modules/astro-theme-pure/components/basic/index.ts\"\n   export { default as Footer } from './Footer.astro'\n   export { default as Header } from './Header.astro'\n   export { default as ThemeProvider } from './ThemeProvider.astro'\n   ```\n\n   Then you get the `Footer` component source code at `node_modules/astro-theme-pure/components/basic/Footer.astro`.\n\n3. Copy the `Footer.astro` file to your project:\n\n   ```bash\n   cp node_modules/astro-theme-pure/components/basic/Footer.astro src/components/custom/Footer.astro\n   ```\n\n4. Solve the sub-dependencies problem:\n\n   ```astro title=\"src/components/custom/Footer.astro\"\n   ---\n   import config from 'virtual:config'\n\n   import { Icon } from '../user' // [!code --]\n   import { Icon } from 'astro-pure/user' // [!code ++]\n   // ...\n   ---\n   ```\n\n5. Change the reference in `BaseLayout.astro`:\n\n   ```astro title=\"src/layout/BaseLayout.astro\"\n    ---\n    import { Footer, Header, ThemeProvider } from 'astro-pure/components/basic' // [!code --]\n    import { Header, ThemeProvider } from 'astro-pure/components/basic' // [!code ++]\n    import { Footer } from '@/components/custom/Footer.astro' // [!code ++]\n    // ...\n    ---\n    ```\n\n\u003C/Steps>\n\nThen you've done a \"localization\" of the component.\n\n## Package Mode\n\n\u003CAside type='danger' title={'Use at Your Own Risk'.toUpperCase()}>\nKeep cautious for change the underlying code \u003CSpoiler>~~底层代码不可突破，祖宗之法不可变~~\u003C/Spoiler>, unless you know what you are doing.

This will give you more flexibility to add more links or other information:\n\n  ```ts title=\"src/site.config.ts\"\n  export const theme: ThemeUserConfig = {\n    footer: {\n      links: [ // [!code highlight:12]\n        {\n          title: 'Moe ICP 114514',\n          link: 'https://icp.gov.moe/?keyword=114514',\n          style: 'text-sm' // Uno/TW CSS class\n        },\n        {\n          title: 'Site Policy',\n          link: '/terms/list',\n          pos: 2 // position set to 2 will be appended to copyright line\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### v4.0.2-beta\n\n- Consider moving tool icons to a new path such as `src/assets/tools/`; this may help users know which ones are relevant to tools.\n- Changed links `applyTip` to a custom array style:\n\n  ```ts title=\"src/site.config.ts\"\n  export const integ: IntegrationUserConfig = {\n    links: {\n      applyTip: [\n        { name: 'Name', val: theme.title }, // [!code highlight:4]\n        { name: 'Desc', val: theme.description || 'Null' },\n        { name: 'Link', val: 'https://astro-pure.js.org/' },\n        { name: 'Avatar', val: 'https://astro-pure.js.org/favicon/favicon.ico' }\n        // You can also add more fields\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Add the env variable `BUN_LINK_PKG`. Set this to `true` to automatically refer to the package `astro-pure` in the path `packages/pure` instead of `node_modules/astro-pure`. This may help users develop the theme or change code for themselves (not recommended for production).\n- Changed the CSS framework to UnoCSS. This will affect `unocss.config.ts` and typography class name settings.\n\n### v4.0.1-beta\n\n- Changed svg deliver import to custom import svg element. This will affect using component for `ToolSelection`. You should change:\n\n  (Optional) Move icons to new path like `src/assets/icons/`\n\n  Then change using code (default at `src/pages/about/index.astro`)\n\n  ```ts title=\"src/pages/about/index.astro\"\n  \u003CToolSection\n    tools={[\n      {\n        name: 'Arch Linux',\n        description: 'Linux Distribution',\n        href: 'https://archlinux.org/',\n        iconPath: 'archlinux' // [!code --]\n        icon: import('@/assets/icons/archlinux.svg?raw') // [!code ++]\n      }\n    ]},\n  />\n  ```\n\n- This changes import a new component `Svg`. See [User Components #Svg Loader](/docs/integrations/components#svg-loader) for usage.\n\n### v4.0.0-alpha\n\n- Move all components, types and utils that are reused to new npm packages `astro-pure`. Affected components are included in . Import method is also changed:\n\n  ```ts\n  import { Button } from '@/components/user' // [!code --]\n  import { Button } from 'astro-pure/user' // [!code ++]\n  ```\n\n- New format config file `src/site.config.ts`. There will be zod schema to validate the config file, and use of config will be changed to:\n\n  ```ts\n  import { siteConfig } from '@/site-config' // [!code --]\n  import config from '@/site-config' // [!code ++]\n  // Or if you want to use the config that is after processed or transformed\n  import config from 'virtual:config' // [!code ++]\n  ```\n\n- Built-in astro config supported. package `astro-pure` will automatically config some integrations like `unocss/astro`, `@astrojs/mdx`, `@astrojs/sitemap`, also with some rehypePlugins and remarkPlugins.\n- Changed search engine to [pagefind](https://pagefind.app/), mainly because Astro v5 will not allow getting collection data directly from client (that is core working mode of Fuse.js search engine).\n- Changed some `BaseHead` tags config to `src/site.config.ts`.\n\n### v3.1.4\n\n- Move config `siteConfig.content.typographyProse` to `integrationConfig.typography.class` in `src/site.config.ts`.\n- Move advanced components to `src/components/advanced`. Affected components are included in [Advanced Components](/docs/integrations/advanced). Import method is also changed:\n\n  ```ts\n  import LinkPreview from '@/components/LinkPreview.astro' // [!code --]\n  import { LinkPreview } from 'astro-pure/advanced' // [!code ++]\n\n  \u003CLinkPreview href='https://www.cloudflare.com/' />\n  ```\n\n- Move `Substats` config to related page `src/pages/about/index.astro`.\n- Changed Github Card component to `GithubCard` in `src/components/advanced`. See [Advanced Components #Github Card](/docs/integrations/advanced#github-card) for usage.\n- Move Links Logbook to `src/site.config.ts`. See [Friend Links #Basic Configurations](/docs/integrations/links#basic-configurations).\n\n### v3.1.3\n\n- Move user components to `src/components/user`. Affected components are included in [User Components](/docs/integrations/components). Import method is also changed:\n\n  ```ts\n  import Button from '@/components/Button' // [!code --]\n  import { Button } from 'astro-pure/user' // [!code ++]\n  ```\n\n- Replace `remark-github-blockquote-alert` plugin to component `Aside`. Check [User Components #Aside](/docs/integrations/components#aside) to know how to migrate.\n\n### v3.1.2 (pre-release)\n\n- Move some configuration items like `telegram`, `walineServerURL` to new structure in `src/site.config.ts`.\n\n### v3.1.1\n\n- Move the internal parts in the `src/utils` to `src/plugins`.\n- Modify the configuration file `astro.config.ts` to `astro.config.mjs`.\n- Update ESLint to latest version and migrate configuration file `.eslintrc.js` to `eslint.config.mjs`.\n- Modify the `prettier.config.js` to `prettier.config.mjs`.\n\n### v3.1.0 (pre-release)\n\n- Changed common content markdown formatter `coverImage` to `heroImage`. You need to modify all your markdown files to replace `coverImage` with `heroImage`.\n\n### v3.0.9\n\nA stable version.\n\nPending update...\n\n## Update Method\n\n### Rebase\n\nIf you create a new project using fork, you can just rebase the theme repository to the latest version.\n\n### Merge Manually\n\nAs the git histories are not the same, you might need to merge the theme repository into your project manually.\n\nA practical way for Windows users is to use the tool [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/).\n\nA filter list may be helpful:\n\n```diff\n## This is a directory/file filter template for WinMerge\nname: Astro Theme Pure\ndesc: Diff for Blog v.s.

You can configure CDN links to improve your site performance.\n\n```ts title=\"src/site.config.ts\"\nexport const theme: ThemeUserConfig = {\n  // ...\n  npmCDN: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm'\n  // Recommend:\n  // - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm\n  // - https://cdn.smartcis.cn/npm\n  // - https://unkpg.com\n  // - https://cdn.cbd.int\n}\n```\n\n## Coding\n\nIt is a good way to use \"Typescript-like\" syntax comment in your `.astro` files. It can ensure your comment will not be rendered in the final production HTML file.\n\n```astro\n---\n// Here is a safe place to put your comment\nimport { AstroComponent } from '@/components'\n---\n\n\u003Cdiv>\n  \u003C!-- This is a bad comment style which will still in the production -->\n  {/* This is a better comment style */}\n  \u003CAstroComponent>Hello, Astro!\u003C/AstroComponent>\n\u003C/div>\n```\n\n## Pictures\n\n### Use optimized component\n\nDisplay optimized images with the `\u003CImage />` component: [Use the built-in `\u003CImage />` Astro component](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#display-optimized-images-with-the-image--component) to display optimized versions of:\n\n- your local images located within the src/ folder\n- configured remote images from authorized sources\n\n`\u003CImage />` can transform a local or authorized remote image’s dimensions, file type, and quality for control over your displayed image. The resulting `\u003Cimg>` tag includes alt, loading, and decoding attributes and infers image dimensions to avoid Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).\n\n\u003CAside title='What is Cumulative Layout Shift?'>\n  Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a Core Web Vital metric for measuring how much content shifted on\n  your page during loading. The `\u003CImage />` component optimizes for CLS by automatically setting the\n  correct width and height for your images.\n\u003C/Aside>\n\nYou can use `loading=\"lazy\"` to enable lazy loading for images.\n\n```astro title=\"src/pages/somepage.astro\"\n---\n// import the Image component and the image\nimport { Image } from 'astro:assets'\n\nimport myImage from '../assets/my_image.png' // Image is 1600x900\n---\n\n\u003C!-- `alt` is mandatory on the Image component -->\n\u003CImage src={myImage} alt='A description of my image.' />\n```\n\n```html\n\u003C!-- Output -->\n\u003Cimg\n  src=\"/_astro/my_image.hash.webp\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"900\"\n  decoding=\"async\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  class=\"my-class\"\n  alt=\"\"\n/>\n```\n\nUsing this, it will transform your images to a WebP format. `.md` and `.mdx` files are enabled default.\n\n### Change Image Size\n\nAlthough this theme has integrated with some known image optimization plugins, you way still need to optimize your images for some key pages like homepage.\n\nA easy way is using online tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to manually compress your images.\n\n### Adapt External Images\n\nIf you are using external images, excepting the lazy-load tag, you can also add [Astro pre-optimize service](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#authorizing-remote-images) for it. This will change external images to local optimized ones.\n\n```js title=\"astro.config.ts\"\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // ...\n  image: {\n    // ...\n    domains: ['\u003Cspecific site domain>'] // [!code ++]\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\u003CAside type='caution'>This may have a bad work for svg files.\u003C/Aside>\n\n## File Size Analysis\n\nInstall npm package `rollup-plugin-visualizer`. Then append the following code to your `astro.config.ts`:\n\n```ts title=\"astro.config.ts\"\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // ...\n  vite: {\n    plugins: [\n      visualizer({\n        emitFile: true,\n        filename: 'stats.html'\n      })\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\nBuild your project and open the generated `stats.html` file to analyze your bundle size.

A static site server like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.\n\nThis theme has not integrated it and will not provide support for it in the future. But don't worry, this doc will guide you to integrate it.\n\n\u003CSteps>\n\n1. Fork the [Friend-Circle-Lite](https://github.com/cworld1/friend-circle-lite).\n2. Modify the `config.yaml` in your forked repository:\n\n   ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n   spider_settings:\n      enable: true\n      json_url: \"\u003Cyour-site>/links.json\" # [!code highlight]\n      article_count: 4\n   ```\n\n3. Go to \"Actions\" page and run workflow \"Friend Circle Lite\" manually to check if it works. This will also generate server files in \"page\" branch.\n\n4. Checkout [docs](https://github.com/willow-god/Friend-Circle-Lite?tab=readme-ov-file#%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2%E9%9D%99%E6%80%81%E7%BD%91%E7%AB%99) to deploy the server files to your static site server.\n\n5. Add [fetching script file `friendCircle.ts`](https://gist.github.com/cworld1/cf0dc6daa89264e6d745d3e68ef8c01c) to your project at path `src/plugins`.\n\n6.

The following steps outline the necessary steps to integrate LaTeX into Astro.js and addresses potential pitfalls along with their solutions.\n\n\u003CSteps>\n\n1. Install Necessary Packages\n\n   Begin by installing `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`. These packages parse and render LaTeX respectively. Use the install commands:\n\n   ```shell\n   bun install remark-math rehype-katex\n   ```\n\n2. Configure Astro\n\n   Modify your Astro configuration to use these plugins. Add the plugins to the markdown configuration section in your `astro.config.ts`:\n\n   ```js title=\"astro.config.ts\"\n   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\n   import remarkMath from 'remark-math';\n   import rehypeKatex from 'rehype-katex';\n\n   export default defineConfig({\n      // ...\n      markdown: {\n         remarkPlugins: [remarkMath],\n         rehypePlugins: [rehypeKatex],\n      },\n   });\n   ```\n\n3. Include KaTeX CSS\n\n   To ensure that LaTeX formulas are styled correctly, include the KaTeX CSS in your HTML layout (in this theme it would be in the `BlogPost.astro` file). Add the following css resources:\n\n   ```astro title=\"src/layouts/BlogPost.astro\"\n   ---\n   import 'katex/dist/katex.min.css'\n   ---\n   ```\n\n   Or use CDN to fasten speed:\n\n   ```astro title=\"src/layouts/BlogPost.astro\"\n   ---\n   import config from '@/site-config'\n   ---\n   \u003Clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href={`${config.npmCDN}/katex@0.16.15/dist/katex.min.css`}>\n   ```\n\n4. Some CSS code is recommended:\n\n   To ensure that the LaTeX formulas are displayed better, you may need to add the following code to `public/styles/global.css`:\n\n   ```css\n   span.katex-display {\n     overflow-y: scroll;\n     padding: 0.5rem;\n   }\n   .katex-html {\n     overflow: auto hidden;\n     padding: 3px;\n   }\n   .katex-html .base {\n     margin-block: 0;\n     margin-inline: auto;\n   }\n   .katex-html .tag {\n     position: relative !important;\n     display: inline-block;\n     padding-inline-start: 0.5rem;\n   }\n   ```\n\n\u003C/Steps>\n\nCommon Pitfalls and Solutions:\n\n- CSS Styling Issues\n  \n  Problem: LaTeX formulas might not render with the correct styles if the KaTeX CSS isn’t loaded.\n\n  Solution: Confirm the KaTeX stylesheet link is correctly placed in the HTML head and is loading without issues. Check for network errors or restrictions that might prevent the CSS from loading.\n\n- Build Errors\n\n  Problem: Errors during build time when processing LaTeX syntax.\n\n  Solution: Ensure that your LaTeX is correctly formatted and that there are no syntax errors in your markdown files. LaTeX syntax errors can break the parser and cause build failures.","src/content/docs/integrations/others.mdx","29a6b98ba77b7254","setup/content",{"id":145,"data":147,"body":151,"filePath":152,"digest":153,"deferredRender":27},{"title":148,"description":149,"tags":150,"draft":26,"order":65},"Authoring Content","Making your own content",[],"import { Aside } from 'astro-pure/user'\n\nAstro helps you [author and present your content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content/). You can write a blog post directly in Astro using Markdown/MDX, or fetch your content from a headless CMS. Astro lets you build a site around your content: you can add a layout to your pages, create an index of posts, and set up an RSS feed to allow readers to subscribe.\n\n## Writing Content\n\nIn Astro, you can author your content in a variety of ways:\n\n- In Markdown files (`.md` or [alternative extensions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/)), designed to make it easy to write rich text content.\n- In MDX (`.mdx`) or Markdoc (`.mdoc`) files with [an official integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/), which can include components and dynamic expressions in your document.\n- Using a [third-party content management system (CMS)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content/#headless-cms-authoring), then pulling that content into a `.astro` page.\n- Other options (less commonly used for content-heavy pages) include [`.astro` files](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#astro-pages) and [`.html` files](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#html-pages).\n\nFor this theme, `.md` and `.mdx` is supported by default.\n\n### Markdown Authoring\n\nMarkdown is a convenient syntax for writing rich text with basic formatting and common elements like headers, lists, and images. Astro has built-in support for Markdown files in your project.\n\nCreate and write a new `.md` file in your code editor or bring in an existing file written in your favorite Markdown editor. Some online Markdown editors like [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) and [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io) will even allow you to edit and sync your work with your Astro repository stored on GitHub.\n\nLet's give you example of [writing Markdown content in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/):\n\n```markdown title=\"src/content/blog/first-article.md\"\n---\ntitle: 'First Article' # (Required, max 60)\ndescription: 'I like writing articles.' # (Required, 10 to 160)\npublishDate: '2024-11-30 00:08:00' # (Required, Date)\ntags:\n  - Markdown # (Also can write format like next line)\nheroImage: { src: './thumbnail.jpg', alt: 'an image targeting my article', color: '#B4C6DA' }\n# thumbnail.jpg should be in the same folder as the article\ndraft: false # (set true will only show in development)\nlanguage: 'English' # (String as you like)\ncomment: true # (set false will disable comment, even if you've enabled it in site-config)\n---\n\n## This is a title\n\nThis is a paragraph.\n```\n\nIf you have a lot of assets, you can create a folder for title like `src/content/blog/first-article/` and put all your assets in there. Of course, your content should be renamed to `index.md` or `index.mdx` and also be contained in this folder.\n\n\u003CAside type='tip'>\n\nIf you want to use remote image for `heroImage`, please add `inferSize: true` or specified `width` and `height` to the object `heroImage`. Example:\n\n```yaml\nheroImage:\n  { src: 'https://img.tukuppt.com/ad_preview/00/15/09/5e715a320b68e.jpg!/fw/980', inferSize: true }\n# Or specified width and height\nheroImage:\n  { src: 'https://img.tukuppt.com/ad_preview/00/15/09/5e715a320b68e.jpg!/fw/980', width: 980, height: 551 }\n```\n\n\u003C/Aside>\n\nToo complex? Simple example just need these:\n\n```markdown title=\"src/content/blog/simple-article.md\"\n---\ntitle: Simple Article\ndescription: Just another simple article.\npublishDate: 2024-07-26\n---\n\nI like writing simple articles.\n```\n\n\u003CAside type='tip'>\nThis theme has a quick script to create a new article for you. Just run `bun pure new \u003Cpost-slug>` in your terminal.\n\u003C/Aside>\n\n### MDX Authoring\n\nThis allows you to include UI elements such as a banner or an interactive carousel along with your text content.\n\nWrite and edit `.mdx` files directly in your code editor, alongside your project files. MDX files are a [supported page file type](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#supported-page-files) in Astro, and may also be used as [content collection entries](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content/#content-collections).\n\nFor integrated components, checkout [User Components](/docs/integrations/components) and [Advanced Components](/docs/integrations/advanced).\n\n### Connect a CMS\n\nSee [Astro: Use a CMS with Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/cms/)\n\n## Pages\n\nAstro uses **file-based routing** to [generate your build URLs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/) based on the file layout of your project `src/pages/` directory.\n\n### Routes\n\n`.astro` [page components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/) as well as Markdown and MDX Files (`.md`, `.mdx`) within the `src/pages/` directory **automatically become pages on your website**. Each page’s route corresponds to its path and filename within the `src/pages/` directory.\n\n```diff\n# Example: Static routes\nsrc/pages/index.astro        -> mysite.com/\nsrc/pages/about.astro        -> mysite.com/about\nsrc/pages/about/index.astro  -> mysite.com/about\nsrc/pages/about/me.astro     -> mysite.com/about/me\nsrc/pages/posts/1.md         -> mysite.com/posts/1\n```\n\n\u003CAside type='tip'>\n\nThere is no separate \"routing config\" to maintain in an Astro project! When you add a file to the `src/pages/` directory, a new route is automatically created for you. In static builds, you can customize the file output format using the [`build.format`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#buildformat) configuration option.\n\n\u003C/Aside>\n\n### Astro Pages\n\nAstro pages use the `.astro` file extension and support the same features as [Astro components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/).\n\n```astro title=\"src/pages/index.astro\"\n---\n\n---\n\n\u003Chtml lang='en'>\n  \u003Chead>\n    \u003Ctitle>My Homepage\u003C/title>\n  \u003C/head>\n  \u003Cbody>\n    \u003Ch1>Welcome to my website!\u003C/h1>\n  \u003C/body>\n\u003C/html>\n```\n\nA page must produce a full HTML document. If not explicitly included, Astro will add the necessary `\u003C!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and `\u003Chead>` content to any `.astro` component located within `src/pages/` by default. You can opt-out of this behavior on a per-component basis by marking it as a [partial](#page-partials) page.\n\nTo avoid repeating the same HTML elements on every page, you can move common `\u003Chead>` and `\u003Cbody>` elements into your own [layout components](/en/basics/layouts/). You can use as many or as few layout components as you'd like.\n\nAnd in this theme, luckily you can use `BaseLayout.astro` as your layout component.\n\n```astro title=\"src/pages/mypage.astro\"\n---\nimport PageLayout from '@/layouts/BaseLayout.astro' // [!code highlight]\n\nconst meta = {\n  title: 'My Page',\n  description: 'My fav page'\n}\nconst highlightColor = '#44AEF6' // Optional\n---\n\n\u003CPageLayout {meta} {highlightColor}>\n  \u003C!-- [!code highlight] -->\n  \u003Cp>My page content, wrapped in a layout!\u003C/p>\n\u003C/PageLayout>\n\u003C!-- [!code highlight] -->\n```\n\n\u003CAside type='tip'>\n  Read more about [layout components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/) in Astro.\n\u003C/Aside>\n\n### Markdown/MDX Pages\n\nWhile `.astro` pages have some flexible features and be friendly to inline / module scripts, `.md` and `.mdx` pages are more suitable for content-focused pages.\n\nAstro also treats any Markdown (`.md`) files inside of `src/pages/` as pages in your final website. If you have the [MDX Integration installed](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#installation), it also treats MDX (`.mdx`) files the same way.\n\n\u003CAside type='caution'>\n\nConsider creating [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) instead of pages for directories of related Markdown files that share a similar structure, such as blog posts or product items.\n\n\u003C/Aside>\n\nMarkdown files can use the special `layout` frontmatter property to specify a [layout component](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/) that will wrap their Markdown content in a full `\u003Chtml>...\u003C/html>` page document.\n\nThis theme supports a good layout for `.md` and `.mdx` files:\n\n```markdown title=\"src/pages/terms/privacy.md\"\n---\nlayout: '@/layouts/IndividualPage.astro'\n\ntitle: 'Privacy Policy'\ndescription: 'Effective date: 2024-11-26'\nlanguage: 'En' # optional\nback: '/terms/list' # optional, default to '/'\nheroImage: { src: './thumbnail.jpg' } # will used to social-image\n---\n\n## Privacy Policy 1\n\nThis is the first section of the privacy policy.\n```\n\n### HTML Pages\n\nFiles with the `.html` file extension can be placed in the `src/pages/` directory and used directly as pages on your site. Note that some key Astro features are not supported in [HTML Components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/#html-components).","src/content/docs/setup/content.mdx","994392fa95107ac9","setup/deployment",{"id":154,"data":156,"body":160,"filePath":161,"digest":162,"deferredRender":27},{"title":157,"description":158,"tags":159,"draft":26,"order":85},"Deployment","Deploy your site to various platforms",[],"import { Aside, Steps } from 'astro-pure/user'\n\n## Package Mode\n\nThis theme which >= v4.0.0 has integrated NPM package mode. Recommended way is remove local package file, and install the theme integration from NPM.

Add environment variable `BUN_LINK_PKG=true`.\n2. Run `bun pure check` to link the package automatically.\n\nThis method can also work on Deployment for other platforms like 'Vercel'. All you need is to add the environment variable to build options on your platform control settings.

Astro provides basic support for a base path — see the \"base\" option in the configuration reference [Astro: base](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) for more.\n2. This theme will not support the base path, as it seriously break down the experience of remote developments. In general, deploying the template with a base path is not recommended because the homepage integrates lists, resume elements, and other features that rely on the template’s source structure.\n3. If you follow the guide and modify the code, you can deploy with a base path, but you cannot use the same project copy to deploy both with and without a base path simultaneously. Proceed at your own risk; do not open issues about this unless you plan to contribute improvements to the docs.\n\n\u003C/Aside>\n\n1. Set the `base` option in `astro.config.ts` to your base path, for example:\n\n   ```ts title=\"astro.config.ts\"\n   export default defineConfig({\n     //   ...\n     base: '/repo-name/' // Replace with your repository name\n   })\n   ```\n\n2.

VOILA!\n\n   You can now [start the Astro dev server](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#start-the-astro-dev-server) and see a live preview of your project while you make it your own!\n\n\u003C/Steps>\n\n### Install Using Fork\n\nYou only need to [click fork button at theme repository](https://github.com/cworld1/astro-theme-pure/fork) to create your project; then clone the forked repository to your local machine.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/\u003Cyour-username>/astro-theme-pure.git\n```\n\nThen, you can start the Astro dev server and see a live preview of your project while you make it your own!\n\n## Start the Dev Server\n\nGo to your project directory:\n\n```shell\ncd ./\u003Cyour-project>\n```\n\n\u003CTabs>\n\u003CTabItem label='bun'>\n```shell\nbun dev\n```\n\u003C/TabItem>\n\u003CTabItem label='pnpm'>\n```shell\npnpm dev\n```\n\u003C/TabItem>\n\u003CTabItem label='yarn'>\n```shell\nyarn run dev\n```\n\u003C/TabItem>\n\u003CTabItem label='npm'>\n```shell\nnpm run dev\n```\n\u003C/TabItem>\n\u003C/Tabs>\n\nNext, please read the configuration notes first and continue configuring the theme.\n\n## Migrate to Astro\n\nSee [Astro: Migrate an existing project to Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/).\n\n## Theme File Structure\n\nThe theme file structure is as follows:\n\n- `public`: Static resources that will be copied to the root directory\n- `src`:\n  - `assets`: Static resources\n  - `components`: Components used in the theme, also include user-like components, like `Card`, `Collapse`, `Spoiler`, etc.\n  - `layouts`: Basic site layouts\n  - `pages`: Pages like `404`, `about`, `blog`, `docs`, `index`, etc.\n  - `plugins`: Extended plugins used in the theme\n  - `types`: Typescript type definitions\n  - `utils`: Utilities\n  - `site.config.ts`: Theme configuration file\n- `astro.config.ts`: Astro configuration file\n- `eslint.config.mjs`: ESLint configuration file\n- `prettier.config.mjs`: Prettier configuration file\n- `uno.config.ts`: UnoCSS configuration file\n- `tsconfig.json`: Typescript configuration file\n- `package.json`: Package information\n\n## Simple Setup\n\n\n\u003CSteps>\n\n1. Remove docs files\n\n   - Remove the `src/pages/docs` directory\n   - Remove the menu declaration in `src/site.config.ts`:\n   \n   ```ts title=\"src/site.config.ts\"\n   export const theme: ThemeUserConfig = {\n      // ...\n      /** Configure the header of your site. */\n      header: {\n         menu: [\n            { title: 'Blog', link: '/blog' },\n            { title: 'Docs', link: '/docs' }, // [!code --]\n            // ...\n         ],\n      },\n   }\n   ```\n\n   - Remove the Content Collection for docs in `src/content.config.ts`:\n\n   ```ts title=\"src/content.config.ts\"\n   const docs = defineCollection({ // [!code --]\n   loader: glob({ base: './src/content/docs', pattern: '**/*.{md,mdx}' }), // [!code --]\n   schema: ({ image }) => // [!code --]\n      z.object({ // [!code --]\n         ... // [!code --]\n      }) // [!code --]\n   }) // [!code --]\n   export const collections = { blog, docs } // [!code --]\n   export const collections = { blog } // [!code ++]\n   ```\n\n2. Remove `packages` directory (this will be imported by our NPM package).\n\n   And remember to change the `workspaces` field in `package.json`:\n\n   ```json title=\"package.json\"\n   {\n     \"name\": \"astro-theme-pure\",\n     \"workspaces\": [ // [!code --]\n       \"packages/*\" // [!code --]\n     ], // [!code --]\n     // ...\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Change the site favicon.\n\n   \u003CAside type='tip'>\n   [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) is a great tool that can help you generate favicons quickly.\n   \u003C/Aside>\n\n   Replace the `public/favicon/*` files with your own favicon.\n\n4. Replace your avatar image.\n\n   Replace the `src/assets/avatar.png` file with your own avatar image.\n\n5. Configure the site\n\n   You can configure your project inside the `src/site.config.ts` configuration file:\n\n   ```ts title=\"src/site.config.ts\"\n   export const theme: ThemeUserConfig = {\n      author: 'CWorld',\n      title: 'Astro Theme Pure',\n      site: 'https://astro-pure.js.org',\n      description: 'Stay hungry, stay foolish',\n      // ...\n   }\n\n   export const integ: IntegrationUserConfig = { /* ... */ }\n   // ...\n   ```\n\n6. Typescript Syntax\n\n   The configuration file `site.config.ts` uses Typescript syntax. If you are not familiar with TS syntax, please read about it [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/typescript/) first.\n\n\u003C/Steps>","src/content/docs/setup/getting-started.mdx","3bda2653a5ef0f6f","setup/configuration",{"id":172,"data":174,"body":178,"filePath":179,"digest":180,"rendered":181},{"title":175,"description":176,"tags":177,"draft":26,"order":131},"Configuration","Configuration files",[],"## Theme Configuration\n\nFile: `src/site.config.ts`\n\npending update...\n\n## Astro Configuration\n\nFile: `astro.config.ts`\n\nYou can configure it to change deployment methods, add rehype & remark plugins, and more.\n\nRead more about Astro configuration [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/configuring-astro/).\n\n## ESLint Configuration\n\nFile: `eslint.config.mjs`\n\nYou can configure ESLint to change rules and security checks.\n\nRead more about ESLint configuration [here](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files).\n\n## Prettier Configuration\n\nFile: `prettier.config.mjs`\n\nYou can configure Prettier to change code formatting rules, this can change your experience using package command `format` and extension support for your favorite IDE.\n\nOptions are available [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options).\n\n## UnoCSS Configuration\n\nFile: `uno.config.ts`\n\nIt is a utility-first CSS framework building custom designs.
